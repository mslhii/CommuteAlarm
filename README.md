# CommuteAlarm
Alarm clock that is set based on the traffic conditions. Uses Google Directions API to get current and future traffic info. Polls it repeatedly using a background Timer service.

Still a WIP, lots of testing needed.

Created branch "mac-dev" to reflect work on my Mac, which is apparently different from the PC in terms of Android Studio file structure.

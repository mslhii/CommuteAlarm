# CommuteAlarm
Alarm clock that is set based on the traffic conditions. Uses Google Directions API to get current and future traffic info. Polls it repeatedly using a background Timer service that is user customizable. Constant WiFi/3G connectivity is needed for polling.

Still a WIP, lots of testing needed. Delayed due to NaNoWriMo

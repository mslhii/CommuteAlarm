# CommuteAlarm
Alarm clock that is set based on the traffic conditions. Uses Google Directions API to get current and future traffic info. Reads user calendar to adjust time. Polls it repeatedly using a background Timer service that is user customizable. Constant WiFi/3G connectivity is needed for polling.

Still a WIP, lots of testing needed. GUI is still considered to be in progress. This is not functional yet. This is considered to be a dead project.
